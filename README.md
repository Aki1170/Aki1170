Hello World, my Name is Axel

I’m a 34-year-old guy from Germany, currently studying Computer Science in my first semester. After 12 years of working as a nurse in various hospitals, I decided to take a new direction in life. I started programming and even enrolled in an academic path to develop new skills. 

Gaming, PCs, anime, and manga have always been a big part of my life. However, at some point, I wanted to stop just consuming and start actively contributing. Since I’m not great at drawing, I focused on coding and even started learning Japanese. 

That’s all for now! I’m really excited to write some lines of code together!
